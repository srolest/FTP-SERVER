# FTP Server with Vagrant and Ansible

## Project objective
The objective of this project is to create an FTP server automatically using Vagrant and Ansible.  
With this work we learn to:
- Create virtual machines.
- Automate configurations.
- Work as a team using GitHub.

The idea is that anyone can set up the server easily by following a few simple steps.

## Tools used
- **GitHub**: to store the project, work as a team and keep track of changes.  
- **Vagrant**: to create the virtual machine where the FTP server will be installed.  
- **Ansible**: to configure the FTP server automatically.  
- **FTP client** (like FileZilla): to check that the server works correctly.

1. Clone the repository on your computer.  
2. Go into the project folder.  
3. Run Vagrant to create the virtual machine.

## Roles
Regarding the roles, both of us will be at the same level and decisions will be made only if we both agree.  
The server will be set up on Serafín’s computer and the client on Hugo’s computer.  
The documentation will be done by both members of the group.
